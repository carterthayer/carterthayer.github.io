|**E Book Reader Mobile App**                                   |
|*CS 309 - Software Development Practices*                     |
|4 Group Members - Backend Developer                                              |

The goal of this project was to create a smarter EBook reading application.
This would allow users to write notes, hilight words, and have additional
tools while reading. In addition, the application would automatically select
important words or phrases within the text and provide a link providing a
pop up to more information on that topic. The idea was formed to help
readers of textbooks remind themselves of important concepts that are
reintroduced later in the text. This projcet was built for mobile using
AngularJS, Ionic and Cordove. The backend was a RESTful API built with
Python using libraries such as: SQLAlchemy, Alembic, NLTK, and Flask RESTful.
Data was stored using a MySQL database provided by Iowa State.

Doing this project, I learned about creating a long running project over the course of the semester.
In addition, I learned about creating a mobile app with Javascript and continued my learning of 
Python, Flask, and RESTful APIs.


|**Comparison of Popular PHP Frameworks**                      |
|*SE 319 - Software Construction and User Interfaces*          |
|2 Group Members                                               |

This project was created to explore and compare some popular (and some not
as popular) PHP frameworks. Both team members on this project (myself and another)
were unfamiliar with building PHP applications. The frameworks compared were
Laravel, Codeignite, and CakePHP. We also wrote the application in plain PHP
for comparision. We reimplemented the same simple library app in each and
reported on our experiences. While the report is not included, the code
is stored on [Github](https://github.com/carterthayer/319Portfolio2).

I learned about various PHP Frameworks for this project.
I was able to compare them and have knowledge that will necessary
if I implement a project with PHP in the future.

|**MIPS Assembly Visualizer**                                  |
|*SE 319 - Software Construction and User Interfaces*          |
|2 Group Members                                               |

This application is web interface for learners of MIPS assembly.
Inspired by CS 321, we thought we could provide a web interface for
stepping through and visualizing MIPS code. The interface displayed
commands, registers and debugging tools and code run the MIPS code.
This application was built using AngularJS, NodeJS and Antlr.
Although it all could have been done client-side, a server was created
to demonstrate socket connections. The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/carterthayer/319Portfolio3).

I learned about AngularJS, NodeJS and communicating between server and client using
Web sockets. In addition, I reaffirmed knowledge about MIPS from CS 321.

|**Facial Recognition Command Line Interface**                 |
|*SE 329 - Project Management*                                 |
|4 Group Members - Architect                                   |
|                                                              |

This project was created with 3 class mates. This was a command line interface tool
that would assist instructers identifying students. The application provided
commands to add a student (and take a picture) or recognize them by their face.
This was created with Python 2.7, OpenCV, Pandas, and Click (Command Line Interface Creation Kit).
This code is available on [Github](https://github.com/AlgorithmArchitects/Facial-Recognition).

I learned about using Python with OpenCV in this project. Additionally,
I learned about writing project plans and retrospectives for project management.

|**Social Media Connection**                 |
|*SE 329 - Project Management*                                 |
|4 Group Members - Architect                                   |

This project was created with 3 class mates. This was a web interface that
can help identify connections between your social networks.
This could help a user or an organization gain more knowledge about their friends.
The Facebook and Twitter APIs were used to collect data for this project.
This code is available on [Github](https://github.com/AlgorithmArchitects/SocialMediaConnections).

I learned about working with Facebook and Twitter APIs as well as using D3.js to create graphs.
In addition, I learned about writing project plans and retrospectives for project management.

|**Search Suggest**                 |
|*SE 329 - Project Management*                                 |

This project was created with 3 class mates. This was a web interface that
will provide search results. In addition an upvote, downvote system was implemented to
allow crowdsourcing to find the best results. This was done with Firebase to provide realtime
updates to users. A C# server was implemented to look through the pages of the possible results
to suggest new keywords to use.
This code is available on [Github](https://github.com/AlgorithmArchitects/search-suggest).

I learned about working with some basic C# and communicating witha C# server to Javascript with
Websockets. In adition, I learned about Firebase to provide real time database updates to a Web interface.
