The goal of this project is to create a web-based platform for the City of Ames. This will be for
citizens of the City of Ames to connect with donation outlets to donate their unused items.
Outlets will be able to create accounts and make changes to their publicaly available information
as approved by administrators of the system. From there, they will be able to select which items they accept as donations.
Citizens who wish to donate items can input the things they have available then search for the best outlet for them.
The list of donation centers can be sorted by factors such as location, amount of items accepted, and accepting high priority donations.

This application is in progress and will be completed by May 2017.
