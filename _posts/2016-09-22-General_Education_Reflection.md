My goals for the the next couple years are to move on and begin a career in software engineering.
I would like to be able to work on new and interesting projects throughout my career and continue
to explore new technologies. Beyond that, I hope to continue working in the industry with a bigger,
more important role in developing software.

The general education classes that I have taken have helped me with software engineering in many non-technical ways.
Courses like English 314 have allowed to me improve writing and communication abilities that I have been able to
apply in my software projects. Additionally, courses like Religion 210 and Music 102 have allowed me to see
and consider other cultures and experiences throughout the world. Differences in cultures are an
important thing to consider when bringing software to a large, worldwide audience.
Additionally, courses like Psych 101 have allowed me to consider the way people thing, which could
be applicable for creating good software experiences.
