{{ site.description }}

I have experience programming with [Python](http://python.org){:target="_blank"},
[Java](https://www.java.com){:target="_blank"} [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/){:target="_blank"}
and more.
In addition, I have experience working cloud services such as
[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I am currently a software engineering student at [Iowa State University](http://iastate.edu){:target="_blank"} and
working as a developer for [Dupont Pioneer](http://pioneer.com){:target="_blank"}.

This portfolio should introduce you to me, my projects and my experience both at Iowa State and 
in the workplace.
